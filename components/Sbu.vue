        <span class="header">WHO ARE THE SPACE BABIEZ ?</span> Space Babiez are
        dope-keepsakes with rarity, level up properties, and utility. Each Baby
        will have one tradeable copy and there will only be 4000 Origin Babiez
        and 1000 Collectors Cards created before Generation II is produced.
        There are 115 traits included in the production of the Origin Babiez
        with special rarities. The features included in the production of the
        Collector Cards are infinite and carefully independently curated to
        produce a cohesive theme. Collector Cards are conceptualized from
        varying themes and are released in sets. A set can have between 2-50
        collectibles depending on the theme. Some Babiez are more grand than
        others but all of them are super dope, personal, and quirky.

        <span class="header">WHAT IS SBU?</span> SBU or Space Baby Univerze is
        where the Babiez live and the Guardianz play. We are bringing back the
        nostalgia of true collectible cards and keepsakes that can be comparable
        to some of our childhood favorites. This project was created in essence
        of the nostalgic merging elements of Pokemon, Harry Potter, Digimon,
        Beanie Babies, Gigapets, and more. SBU is divided into 3 galaxies:

        <span class="header">WHY BECOME A GUARDIAN?</span> Beyond owning a
        unique piece of digital art that will increase in function, Guardianz
        will have member only access to exclusive content and other rewards by
        the unlocking of our roadmap. The value of the utility of the Space Baby
        can only be measured by the innovation and dedication of the developers.
        Our goal is to deploy some pretty cool functions into Space Baby
        Univerze while building our Digital Utopia. This will include
        collaborating with people like you to keep the SBU thriving. Guardianz
        of the Babiez work together to create an unlimited future for Kidz
        everywhere. Guardianz are included in all of our community initiatives,
        which will have physical and virtual components. You will have a vote in
        what charities and communities we will support and help steer the
        spaceship to our final destination as a community. SBU also takes care
        of our own! As Guardianz, you are just as important to the world as each
        Space Baby. We will invest US Dollars into a community fund to assist
        our members in times of need through SBU initiatives. SBU is not here to
        promise the world, but we are dedicated to innovation, art, amuzement,
        and community which are considered the building blocks of our brand.

        <span class="header">WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH A SPACE BABY?</span> Guardianz
        will have the opportunity to generate passive income from their Baby
        through merch drops, animation, and other commercial usages. Guardianz
        have copyright transfer rights to use and monetize your baby as you
        wish. These opportunities are backed by the entire SBU and the Space
        Baby Project Staff. The most favorited Babiez can generate massive
        income for its owner through SBU backed initiatives. More utilities to
        be announced during Launch Week.
